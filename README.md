# Concept Grapher
Concept map tool written with Typescript and Electron.

Track thoughts, ideas, project decisions or what you eat for lunch every day in a simple & pretty tool that doesn't require you to be online or trust somebody's cloud with your data.

## Purpose
The purpose of Concept Grapher is to provide an open source concept map creator you can use offline and without attachment to any cloud service. The idea grew from frustration with existing solutions that either wouldn't allow non-hierarchical links between concepts (mind mapping instead of concept mapping), lock you in with a cloud (can't be used for professional work with private data) or have outdated looking interfaces.

Also existing solutions don't eat enough RAM, so the 32GB upgrade you spent so much money on doesn't provide any value. This Electron based app is here to change that.
